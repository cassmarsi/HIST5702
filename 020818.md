### Class Notes
# February 8, 2018

By engaging with the digital, think about your relationship with public history (is it challenging it?); is what I'm doing even history? 

Questions -- I think that this, along with my performance class this term, are really linking back to the original reasons why I'm here. And that is, I like to think about this stuff. I sometimes worry that I like reflecting or theorizing more than I actually want to complete my project. And when I get the chance to do projects like this, where, as I've mentioned before, I feel like I'm back in my art classes, I wonder: am I really doing history? Building bridges, digital as glue?
