By engaging with the digital, think about your relationship with public history (is it challenging it?); is what I'm doing even history? 

#### Hard Questions

Questions -- I think that this, along with my performance class this term, are really linking back to the original reasons why I'm here. And that is, I like to think about this stuff. I sometimes worry that I like reflecting or theorizing more than I actually want to complete my project. And when I get the chance to do projects like this, where, as I've mentioned before, I feel like I'm back in my art classes, I wonder: am I really doing history? Building bridges, digital as glue?

- the digital space as physical space/imagining it as a physical space - - or as an emotional space

- avoid mere "tool use" of the digital, it's not an means to an end

- fold your insecurities into the process

- make a list of what you actually have to know to do this, what you already know, what other people are writing and doing

- public history as democratising? - - what can I do/build/engage with this in mind?

#### Generonimos

#### Build (a museum challenge?)
