### Class notes
#### 1st Oral Reports

-if using commands, don't forget to copy them into devlogs so that you don't lose them; narrative

-Cristina: empty land of Lebreton Flats; projection mapping = form of resistance; Ralph Burton, painted scene of the flats as were being demolished (http://urbsite.blogspot.ca/2010/03/ralph-burton-on-lebreton-flats.html?view=classic); now site of war museum; add video or overlay something over these paintings?; where to project?; sound?; beyond the provincial boundary??

-Kira: ARIS, creating fictive narratives and characters for some institutions in Ottawa; game aspect --have these sites as "boss sites"; historical fiction that's interactive and changeable; anchors in reality but floats in fiction

-Nathalie: projection mapping; stardust by [Chowaniec project](https://www.wallspacegallery.ca/events/2017/9/13/chowaniec-projects-stardust); Chinatown (original location, Bank&Albert st); temporary (a window into the past); images of places that were physically in that spot

-Dany: thinking of public criticism; Ottawa/Gatineau region was known as software dev of the north, but museum isn't really talking about this history; pushing back against this (esp. with video games); do something inside the museum?; a lot of material didn't make the cut for the traveling exhibit; the how-to which is written up after the process can also be "guerilla" -- can inspire others, be out in the world

-Jen: projection mapping (also Ottawa Art Gallery); capitalgems (map of ruins in ottawa); mapping the downtown ruins through projection mapping -- project rest of building onto it; or killer tree game!!!

-Katherine: Historical Zombies run!; soundscapes, hopping through time along the Rideau canal; SonicMaps, but it crashes every time; game instead? talking to people through the game; Landsdowne? sonified projection of time

-Ayana: projection mapping; Northern lights show and playing with the transcript (https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/sound-light-show/universal-accessibility/transcript-northern-lights.html); exploding text app (lizadaly.com/projects/a-physical-book); re-write to new text

-Me: simple geolocation with Mixare; having someone following sound coming from somewhere; tech lending library (sensors you can take out); building your own device; recylcing sounds through historical memory; ARIS? people can submit sounds; get audacity (there's a tutorial on programming historian); unity to make augmented reality; location -- find a site where you wouldn't imagine having those sounds; uncommon sounds?; freesound.org

-Denise: light projection around Carleton to tell counter-narratives; make our own spaces (canvas tent for example); Carleton banners, make our own?; murder mystery aris game (thinking of west of loathing); 19th c. Ottawa; playing around with Ottawa's history
