studio time
- you can be evocative, even if it's not "true"

-working with musicalgorithms: it's pretty hard to have any kind of control on the melody, but some pretty interesting results, especially when you listen to the clips separately. So how can I combine these sounds? If I'm using longitude and latitude, can I use the clips they create as inspiration rather than as a the set melody??
-what would be the point of the map? need to have a reason behind this, rather than doing it all on Aris... explain
-any way to do this with arduino rather than aris? what kinds of sensors could I use to trigger the sounds? and what would I be triggering?
-I need to figure out what story I'm telling
