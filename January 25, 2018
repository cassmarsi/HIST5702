# Class notes
do you think about the ephemeral when you work/create?
does it change the outcome?

Bey: changing one person's life should be the goal
* in public history, public is never one person
* what happens when it is?

## Public history still operating on a broadcast model
but with the digital, you can get down to the individual

how to get beyond text?
implications of anonymity... 
aesthetic shock to be confronted with truth? right now, huge coordinated attack on "truth"... is it more subversive to create something that is founded on truth, and gravitas, authority

Bey: "Later they will come to realize that for a few moments they believed in something extraordinary..." (Chapter 2)
danger in this too though
* where do I draw the line?
* where are your boundaries?
  * different tech = different answers
